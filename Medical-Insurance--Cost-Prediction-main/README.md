This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates individual medical insurance premiums based on various demographic and health-related factors. Leveraging regression techniques, this project focuses on understanding and quantifying the relationships between the cost of medical insurance and variables such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and geographical region. To achieve this, the project starts with the collection and preprocessing of a comprehensive dataset. The dataset we have chosen consists of 1340 rows and 7 columns . Data set was already well structured with-out any missing values .So to demonstrate preprocessing we have inserted 20 new values into the dataset which have certain missing values in the columns like bmi,no.children and then we have performed the appropriate preprocessing for the new dataset . Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is then conducted to uncover patterns and correlations within the data, providing a solid foundation for model development. The core of the project involves the application of regression algorithms to predict medical insurance costs. Regression is chosen for its ability to model continuous outcomes and its interpretability. Linear regression, as well as more advanced techniques like multiple regression, are explored to capture the complex relationships between the dependent variable (insurance cost) and the independent variables (age, gender, BMI, etc.). 

 For individuals, the model provides transparency into how their personal and health characteristics affect their insurance premiums, empowering them to make informed decisions about their health and finances. For families we will implement family floater health insurance which will provide the appropriate pre-mium cost for the entire family. Moreover, a user-friendly interface can be developed to allow users to input their data and receive an es-timated insurance cost. This interface, whether a web application or a desktop tool, makes the model ac-cessible to a wider audience, enhancing its practical utility. And the same web application is deployed on the internet with the help of streamlit tool.

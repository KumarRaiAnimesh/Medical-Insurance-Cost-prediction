Medical Insurance Cost Prediction App
This project predicts medical insurance costs based on a user's profile, using machine learning and AI. It is designed to provide an estimation of insurance premiums based on personal data such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

Features
Predicts medical insurance costs using a trained ML model.
Utilizes various user demographic and health-related features.
Clean and user-friendly interface for easy input and result visualization.
Technologies Used
Python for data processing and model building.
Machine Learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic regression etc.).
Libraries:
scikit-learn for model building and prediction.
pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.
Flask/Streamlit for the web interface (if applicable).
GitHub Actions (optional) for CI/CD (if implemented).
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is sourced from Kagle and contains the following features:

Age: The age of the individual.
Gender: The sex of the individual (male or female).
BMI: Body Mass Index.
Children: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
Smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
Region: The individual's residential region.
Model Overview
The app uses a supervised machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs. Below are the steps involved in building the model:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Analysis to determine the most important predictors of medical insurance cost.
Model Training: A [model name] was used for training, along with cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation: The model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-Squared.
